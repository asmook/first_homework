				<p>I grew up in Illinois, just south of Chicago, in a small farming town called Herscher. I've also lived in Wisconsin, Alabama, and now beautiful Colorado! I've chosen a few different career paths in life but none of them seem to have been a proper fit for me. A few months ago i decided to change my career path and go to a bootcamp for something i know literally nothing about! It's rather typical of me to jump in both feet first, without even knowing how deep the water is. I'm very ecited to change gears and learn somthing completely foreign to me, which is computer programming and web developing. In my free time I love hanging out with my big pitbull best friend, June. Other interests of mine are going to shows, exploring the mountains, painting, playing guitar (very poorly i might add) or just chillin at home with some tea and a movie or book.
